dailymile_export
================

Export entries from dailymile using the API.

http://www.dailymile.com/api/documentation


Currently provides export to tab-delimited file (.tsv).


## Why write my own exporter?  

The built-in export feature of dailymile is abysmal.

The dailymile website export only includes a small number of the available data fields 
(date,activity_type,distance,time,felt,elevation_gain). I have spent a lot of time over
the years using dailymile as my serious runner training log. I want to be able to get
my data out (and be able to analyze it with my own tools, etc.).


## Future

I hope to export the gear information (so I can track shoe mileage) which isn't even available in the API.

Maybe eventually I will include additional fields such as tags and weather.
