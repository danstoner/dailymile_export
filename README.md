dailymile_export
================

*** THE CODE DOES NOT WORK YET!!! ***

Export entries from dailymile using the API.

http://www.dailymile.com/api/documentation


Why write my own exporter?  The built-in export feature of dailymile is abysmal.

I also want to be able to extract the gear info which isn't even avaialable in the API.
