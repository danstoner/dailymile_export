Official time 3:12:50 (Boston Qualifier!), Masters Winner, PR by over 13 minutes, top-10, and just a few places out of the overall cash prizes. Would not have done this without the last 6 miles of pacing from Matthew Howland. I was trying to run without any gels or sugar but started to cramp in the hammies near mile 20. Strawberry Banana Gu drove the cramping away. I had 3 possible goals going into the race... 1. break 3 hours, or 2. run a BQ, or 3. get a PR.  Glad I was able to hit my intermediate goal but wow, the marathon is a beast.

Best part is that I was able to put on pants afterward without having any muscle cramps. Fueled with combination of gels and bananas (BOO! none of the aid stations had gel as advertised). Weather forecast was changing all week, turned out to be nice morning! Rain stayed away, temps dropped a degree during the run, and there was a nice \"breeze\" (gusts up to 15 - 20 mph). Beautiful course through horse country.

Otherwise, they make a great minimal shoe have good traction on trail surfaces.

      "description" : "I was getting ready for my LONG run this morning when I turned around to find my youngest daughter sitting there in her running clothes. She said \"I want to run with you!\" How could I say \"no\" to that?  We ran around our neighborhood together in the dark for a little bit before I sat her down with breakfast and then I finished packing up to hit the trails of San Felasco. I ran from the south side hiking trails to the north side horse trails. I explored some of the mountain bike trails such as \"Hidden Rise\". I only saw two groups of riders and otherwise had the north side trails to myself. I am kind of estimating pace and distance, but this was definitely my lifetime longest run ever!   Weather was nice with a breeze and light mist much of the morning. Nature today included a snake that I almost stepped on, I think it was a cottonmouth! Now, two weeks of recovery before my 50k race.",

      "description" : "Temps in the 50s made for a potentially perfect run. Wore my MWU3. I stopped wearing them last year since I wanted to save them for fast races. Tonight I wanted to get a good test run in them before the upcoming half marathon. Started off feeling great but after about 2 miles I began feeling pains in strange places like my calf, knees, glute/hip. Also had some serious pain in my achilles tendon for a bit. I was moving well without much effort and feeling good but I had to stop because I felt like I was on the edge of an injury. Pretty pissed I had to cut the run short. Raised heels are evil. I'm likely going 100 percent Zero Drop from now on.",

I modified my normal route slightly and didn't take the grassy side trail into the woods since it hasn't been mowed in a while (tall wet grass). The main trail that is normally softy sandy was in good shape due to the rains. Started the day with tired and sore legs from the hard running earlier in the week. I got a little over 50 minutes warmup on my usual route before starting the tempo. Feeling very fit!",

Hopefully I can put some actual miles in soon and make better food choices.",

The last loop was really tough physically and mentally, had trouble picking up the legs. Matt C. was supposed to come out but bailed due to fear of muddy trails.  Larabar + NUUN worked great. I ate two bars total and had two water bottles with NUUN spaced out over the run and never felt any stomach discomfort.  Started getting a knot/cramp in my quad during lap 2 (before Larabar and NUUN). Fueled up for lap 3 and the knot went away.

Had a nice strong breeze the whole time bringing in cloud cover. I think it would have been hot and miserable otherwise. The trails are nice and wide (and flat), this might make a good location for a group trail run. There is of course some sugar sand but really not bad, most trails are covered in leaves or pine needles or planted in grass. The Yellow loop is a convenient 5k. Taking a map along was very helpful, I would have had trouble without it.  Wore my NB MT00 sockless, had no issues.  Lesson of the day: Top of your water bottle when you get the chance.

      "description" : "Actually felt really good at the start since it was nice and cool. It started to heat up around 10am which definitely affected the back half of my run. Experimenting with marathon fuels, this morning was honey + blackstrap molasses which worked great. I was moving well and feeling good. Unfortunately the \"sugar\" was all gone by the 2nd lap and I crashed hard shortly after 2 hours. It seems like once I start taking sweets I will have to keep it going in. I will have to ponder this since most of my morning runs are in the fasted state and I don't normally bonk that hard.",

Cold day (32 degrees), lots of icicles hanging from the rock formations. The section between Old Man's Cave and Cedar Falls is technical with rocks, roots, and stone stairways to navigate. I was glad to have my Altra Superiors. The section between Cedar Falls and Ash Cave is not technical but has some serious hills leading up to the fire tower.",

Adjustments: I am going to move my steep hill sprints their own day so they don't affect my specific training on track day. Will possibly take a recovery week. 6 steep hill sprints. 4 x 1000m, 1 x 400m. Splits (rest): 3:30 (1:40), 3:33 (2:48), 3:39 (3:14), 3:55 (3:17), 1:14 for 400m.",

However, it was still hot.  Had a decent race but fizzled a bit on mile 3, wasn't really mentally prepared for the pain and suffering.  Won my age group and 7th overall.  I was invited to run in the team challenge, our team got 2nd place which means a donation to Tyler's Hope (a foundation for research into treating Dystonia).  Felt good to contribute to the team effort.",

The trails were rooty and rocky and beautiful.  Didn't see another human except for the guy who convinced me (thank you!) to continue on up the trail to Rough Ridge.  The views of Grandfather Mountain and the surrounding area were spectacular.  Soft Star RunAmoc DASH with trail sole were awesome for this run.  The trail sole had plenty of protection from the roots and traction was great on the rounded boulders of the Appalachians.  According to my watch I was actually 10 minutes slower on the way down than the way up.  I did not run with GPS but according to this site I believe the elevation of my run ranged from 3600 feet - 4600 feet.  http://b-fick.com/gps/2008/tanawha-trail",

The excitement got to me and I went out too fast, I was way ahead of my breathing and hurting for most of the race.  Wore my Soft Star RunAmoc Smooth moccasins.  They were awesome on the grassy and trail sections, did fine on the road sections.  One thing I didn't like about the course is that we caught up to the slow walkers with their strollers and kids, so I had to weave and dodge in the last mile to avoid plowing through some people or running over the little ones who stopped right in front of me to pick something up off the trail.  Lots of good runners there today, luckily overall awards went 3-deep so I managed to win my age group. Official time 40:27. Mile splits:  6:08, 6:27, 6:43, 6:47, 6:32, 6:36.",

Later I saw a bobcat run across the trail in front of me! I saw a lone, black wild hog who didn't seem particularly skittish. Also, of course, some deer. Bumped into some nice humans, too. Today was a big run to cap a big week of running. Last 3 miles under 8 minute per mile pace. Fueled only by creme in my coffee this morning, I continue trying to get more efficient at burning fat.",

      "description" : "A long day of trail running at San Felasco in the heat wearing my Merrell Vapor Gloves. I started the morning by exploring the hiking trails on the south side of Millhopper Road. Then I followed blue blaze trail to a service road, crossed the gate into the wilderness area, and ended up on horse trails on the north side of the park. Lots of mountain bikes out today. I wandered on curvy singletrack to the north parking area to refill my water bottles and cool down. I was hot and tired by this point (3 hours in and approaching noon), so I wanted to avoid the singletrack on the way back. I needed to get to the bridges near the Soggy Bottom / CreekSide loops to hop back on the horse trails and find that gate. Never did find my way. Next time I will take a map. After getting lost, using up all my food and gels, and almost running out of water, I decided to cross the wilderness swamp that I had used in years past (follow the powerlines). I didn't need to wade through anything more than ankle-deep water (whew!). I did a lot walking during that last hour. I was glad to arrive back at my car with cold water and food waiting for me. Today was a nice adventure (despite the biting flies and ticks), and I saw a couple of hawks, a big wise old owl, some deer (including a cute little fawn), and a large herd of feral pigs. Love the Vapor Gloves.",

Glad to have running buddies out there early in the morning (thanks Stephanie, Meredith, and John D.).  The track was really really really crowded.  Felt good enough after to finish with some surges on the long gentle uphills on my run home.",

      "description" : "Longest run of my whole life! Wasn't feeling perfect, I had some stomach distress yesterday and this morning probably due to some \"unusual\" famers' market greens I ate yesterday. Took fuel along (mostly honey). I guess it helped, but I still hit a wall at mile 20. Legs just quit, couldn't lift them. It also warmed up a lot by the time I shuffled in a smidge before noon. Thought I was running easy for the first half but maybe still going too fast (mostly 8 minute miles with a few faster sections which should be alright since my breathing was easy the whole time, but now I'm less confident about my target marathon race pace). Marathoners are CRAZY for running that far. ;)  Tested race day equipment: RaceReady shorts with pockets, Inov-8 Bare-X Lite 150, gel containers, and my Florida Track Club singlet. Also carried water but I won't do that on race day.",

Ran parking lot to parking lot with 2 x Conquistador in the middle. Nice cool day. Trails were in good shape day after Tour de Felasco MTB and I mostly had them to myself. Forgot to charge my phone last night so I'm guessing at pace/distance. Meant to eat something mid-run but I forgot that, too. This caps off a 60 mile week.",

I had to remove a tiny thorn from my heel and I hit a rock or something that really hurt for a while. It was very hard to keep up the cadence and lift towards the end, so I was landing heavier on my whole foot than I wanted.  The feet and calves are sore.  My knees feel great, though.",

The plan was to go out under control, just try to stay nice and smooth. I think I executed well, felt strong through the 2nd half of the race, crushed mile 5, had a great finish kick.

I took us out just a little fast on the first lap and even though I thought I was pushing lap 3 it was still slow. We finished in 5:13 which is still not bad for this newly minted \"Masters\" runner. Splits: 1:12 (including the \"extra\" distance at the start), 1:19, 1:21, 1:20.\n\nProper pacing is hard, and the Mile is a distance that requires specific training for optimal performance.

Had plenty of fuel and actually let it digest before running... it was lasagna night at Leonardos (Millhopper).  I ran on major streets which were well-lit. Running in the upper end of my aerobic capacity for sure. I never stopped my watch during the run, so the overall time included all the stops. I had to take off my VFF and run barefoot for a few minutes to get rid of an arch cramp.  Getting them back on again took a while. And now I am drinking a beer because I earned it."

I think my GPS cheated me out of some distance, especially on the twisty parts, since the legs felt strong and that I was moving better than 10:30 pace.  I saw deer and some feral pigs, very few humans.  Foot bothered me just a little bit during the run but didn't notice my ribs at all.

I had asymmetric arm carriage 2. I had completely lost the \"falling forward\" pattern. I noticed while running tonight that falling forward encourages \"popping\" the feet back up off the ground more quickly. I remember that! But I had not been doing it. I wore my Altra Sampsons for the first time in a while. I think my previous Achilles complaints from these shoes stemmed from the fact that I was doing it wrong. Better form = no pains. It also means faster pace with less effort.",

I'm a little disappointed I didn't improve my 5k time since I know I'm getting back into serious shape (it's probably been 15 years since I have been this fit).

Stomach woes stayed away, but I think my energy stores were low due to issues the past two days.  Did my best to keep up on the gatorade. I really need to learn how to drink out of a paper cup and not slop it all over myself or half-drown myself.  I dressed perfectly for the cold morning, shedding my jacket after the first mile. The temps probably went up 15 degrees during the race.  Got a great t-shirt and the age group award was an awesome Florida Track Club pint glass. Cheers!

The Adidas Kanadia are on sale at Sports Authority for $50, and they have clearance section in the back with Kanadia 2 from last year in less boring colors. I wanted to get new shoes since my feet have expanded too much for my Nike Frees and the Frees just have too much heel lift.
