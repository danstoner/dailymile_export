On hard surfaces I could definitely feel the knot under the left foot to the point of being painful.  The right foot was fine.  Probably that shoddy construction (by me!). The cord between my toes was a little uncomfortable.  However, on soft surfaces these were awesome for running over sticks and pine cones.  Traction was good all-around.		Huarache Sandals		110

2082456	http://www.dailymile.com/entries/2082456	2010-06-09T04:00:00Z	Hogtown Creek Greenway	Running	alright		1	miles	Ran by myself so I could work on form.  I had to try out my new RunAmocs!  I like them a lot.  Seems like they are a little bit small (my toes end up pushing on the front inside of the moccasin) even though the Soft Star web site says to go smaller if between sizes (I wear size 9 1/2, ordered size 9).  The longest part of the shoe seems too close to the middle of the shoe, rather than offset in front of the big toe.  Also, the top of the shoe stretches over the big toe like a tent (as if there is not enough internal height). Not sure if a larger size would fix these issues or maybe just have to run in them more than once.		RunAmoc		110

She actually had a nice midfoot strike, even though she was wearing marshmallow shoes.  I hung in behind them for a while, and when I turned onto 8th Ave I just started cruising (the other runners had stopped to rest)... and kept cruising... and kept cruising.  Pretty sure this is my fastest barefoot run yet.  There were quite a few people out today, so I contributed some good barefoot exposure to the world.

It explains why we can look ahead on the trail (not down at our feet) and still somehow avoid stepping on sharp things.  Now, someone go research this.  :)

""We do know a bit more about the appropriate length of the recovery 
period, thanks to research carried out with marathon runners. A study 
carried out by Michael Warhol and his colleagues at Harvard Medical 
School and Tufts University uncovered extensive damage in marathoners' 
leg muscles immediately after the 26.2-mile race (broken cell fibres, 
swollen cells, mangled membranes, degenerated mitochondria, and 
damaged blood vessels were present). Repair of this sorry state of 
affairs took about four weeks, and in some runners it took even longer 
('Skeletal Muscle Injury and Repair in Marathon Runners after 
Competition,' American Journal of Pathology, vol. 118, pp. 331-339, 
1985).  True, not all endurance athletes are marathon runners, but 
subsequent research showed that moderate endurance training (about 31 
miles of running per week - with no marathon running) can produce 
similar damage in 33 per cent of runners and slightly heavier training 
(48 miles per week with no marathoning) can induce comparable damage 
in the majority of runners ('Structural and Ultrastructural Changes in 
Skeletal Muscle Associated with Long-Distance Training and Running,' 
International Journal of Sports Medicine, vol. 10, pp. S156-159, 
1989). Thus, we can conclude that almost all serious runners need a 
recovery period . . . """

Some people never see those. Ran 4 x Hammock Cutoff loop so had lots of hills.  The last loop was really tough physically and mentally, had trouble picking up the legs.

I ate two bars total and had two water bottles with NUUN spaced out over the run and never felt any stomach discomfort.  Started getting a knot/cramp in my quad during lap 2 (before Larabar and NUUN). Fueled up for lap 3 and the knot went away.

Barefoot is the way to go when running on sugary sand trails.  Third in my age group.  First half of the race I was at the back of the lead pack.  I died hard hard hard after 1 hour 50 minutes... for some reason I thought I should try to race the second (last) 7-mile loop. My shoulders and back tied in knots.  After the race, lots of people were interested in my bare feet... maybe I'll make the highlight reel. A Gainesville woman (Kristen Bryant) won the female side of our age group.	5	Barefoot	sunny	1962

Only ran on sidewalks since it was dark, but the Adidas Kanadia 3 shoes lend themselves nicely to a midfoot strike. They are stiff and heavy but they let my feet land the right way. The Adidas Kanadia are on sale at Sports Authority for $50, and they have clearance section in the back with Kanadia 2 from last year in less boring colors. I wanted to get new shoes since my feet have expanded too much for my Nike Frees and the Frees just have too much heel lift.  I could not wait for all of the new minimalist shoes coming out in spring 2011.	3	Adidas Kanadia 3		376

They are kind of like little armored tanks on my feet, I could plow right over pretty much anything. It was fun to be able to bomb down the hills. They did well on the sandy trails.  The downside is that my left foot developed some PF-like pain and caused something like ITBS in my right leg. These caused me to run the next loop in different shoes.  Despite Gainesville having four 5ks on the same day, that Saturday trail running group was out in force.	3	Adidas Kanadia 3		883

Walked some parts and enjoyed the thick sand.  Barefoot helped the pains developed from previous loops go away.

I was under-veggied, under-fruited, over-meated, and over-junk-fooded this week.  I think my body and glutes noticed that I've been skipping my PT and core strengthening lately.  On the bright side, I think all of the push-ups etc. are paying off... I'm pretty sure I received a cat call from a car full of college girls.	4	Mizuno Wave Universe 3		986

The sand was really soft, running was difficult as my feet kind of sunk in with every step... it felt kind of like running through deep snow.  I think total mileage for the trip was around 6 miles.  Also did a lot of hiking in the El Yunque national rain forest in my 4mm cherry huarache sandals.

I think I may have bought a half size too small.  My feet drifted up towards the toes a little bit, making the shoe feel smaller than when I tried it at the store.  I had to take off my thick socks.

Beautiful day in the Hammock.  Trails are in great shape due to recent rain and it looks like they cleaned them off for the planned maintenance burns.  Didn't have any noticeable smoke smell.

So bad my back hurt getting up to go each lunch and again at the end of the day.  Sitting is baaaaad, mmm-kay?  Also had a huge Chipotle burrito for lunch. Need to eat smaller lunch and maybe have an afternoon snack instead of suffering the big bloat.  Oh yeah, and I didn't have afternoon coffee like usual.	2	Altra Instinct		994

Started out at what felt like an ""easy"" pace and noticed I ran the first two miles at 8:30 pace. I guess I let my speed creep up from there.  I was pretty tired by the end, though. The biggest change I notice as a result of introducing hill intervals into my training is that I have more knee lift / power / drive in each stride.

Wore my MWU3. I stopped wearing them last year since I wanted to save them for fast races. Tonight I wanted to get a good test run in them before the upcoming half marathon. Started off feeling great but after about 2 miles I began feeling pains in strange places like my calf, knees, glute/hip. Also had some serious pain in my achilles tendon for a bit. I was moving well without much effort and feeling good but I had to stop because I felt like I was on the edge of an injury. Pretty pissed I had to cut the run short. Raised heels are evil. I'm likely going 100 percent Zero Drop from now on.	3	Mizuno Wave Universe 3		667

Inov-8 Bare-X 150 shoes are great for racing.  Stomach woes stayed away, but I think my energy stores were low due to issues the past two days.  Did my best to keep up on the gatorade. I really need to learn how to drink out of a paper cup and not slop it all over myself or half-drown myself.  I dressed perfectly for the cold morning, shedding my jacket after the first mile. The temps probably went up 15 degrees during the race.  Got a great t-shirt and the age group award was an awesome Florida Track Club pint glass. Cheers!

The excitement got to me and I went out too fast, I was way ahead of my breathing and hurting for most of the race.  Wore my Soft Star RunAmoc Smooth moccasins.  They were awesome on the grassy and trail sections, did fine on the road sections.  One thing I didn't like about the course is that we caught up to the slow walkers with their strollers and kids, so I had to weave and dodge in the last mile to avoid plowing through some people or running over the little ones who stopped right in front of me to pick something up off the trail.  Lots of good runners there today, luckily overall awards went 3-deep so I managed to win my age group. Official time 40:27.

Decided to wear my Altra Lone Peak trail shoes. Ran the blue loop with a diversion along the dirt roads under the power lines and along the outside perimeter of the park.

Clearly still recovering from holiday carb overload and the first week back at work, need to get back on the fat burning train and get more sleep. I kept the insoles in my Instincts, thinking that maybe they will last longer that way.  But I don't like them as much with the soft insole and I tend to feel pains further up the legs and even my feet don't feel as good.	1	Altra Instinct Black		994

Ran from the south side of San Felasco (hiking trails) along the power lines to the north side, then did Hammock Hub and part of Tung Nut loop. Really fun run! The only tricky part was crossing the wilderness area.  I think my GPS cheated me out of some distance, especially on the twisty parts, since the legs felt strong and that I was moving better than 10:30 pace.  I saw deer and some feral pigs, very few humans.  Foot bothered me just a little bit during the run but didn't notice my ribs at all.

More protection than Moc3 and Altra Adams.  No squishy cushion to throw off my stride.  The stiffness I noticed when first picking them up did not bother me while running.  They were comfortable sockless at this easy pace and distance.

I had some free time today for a second run, decided to go exploring since I have never run there before.  There are no facilities despite what is shown on the map.  Had a nice strong breeze the whole time bringing in cloud cover. I think it would have been hot and miserable otherwise. The trails are nice and wide (and flat), this might make a good location for a group trail run. There is of course some sugar sand but really not bad, most trails are covered in leaves or pine needles or planted in grass. The Yellow loop is a convenient 5k. Taking a map along was very helpful, I would have had trouble without it.  Wore my NB MT00 sockless, had no issues.  Lesson of the day: Top of your water bottle when you get the chance.  I drank some of mine on the way there and didn't refill from my jug before leaving my car.	2	New Balance Minimus Trail Zero		1288

I had the printed map with me, didn't help. I wanted to run the Yellow loop. I think the map is downright wrong. Also, a Blue trail isn't even on the map but I somehow ended up on it.  Eventually turned around in frustration on two different occasions as the trail seemed to just stop or at least wasn't marked well enough to continue.  I found my way out and back to the car with some difficulty.	2	New Balance Minimus Trail Zero		346

Experimented with Gu, Clif Shots, and Clif Bloks. I like my brand new RaceReady running shorts with pockets, I had plenty of places to stash stuff... and no heat chafing on the inside of my thighs (a first time for long hot runs like this). I felt really bad towards the end, muscles started getting crampy. I thought maybe I drank too much water (carrying two bottles that I refilled multiple times) but when I got home I weighed myself, still about 5 pounds under starting weight so I actually probably didn't drink enough. I was hoping to go closer to 26 miles but I really hit a wall after 3 hours. I haven't run near this distance in a long time so considering everything, I'm happy. And sleepy.

Otherwise, they make a great minimal shoe have good traction on trail surfaces.

Not sure if my body missed the food or the caffeine more. I'm surprised by my calculated pace, based on how I felt I thought I'd be much slower. It was foggy through most of the run and it felt like a lukewarm sauna. Altra Instincts are still my go-to shoe for the long run.

I guess it helped, but I still hit a wall at mile 20. Legs just quit, couldn't lift them. It also warmed up a lot by the time I shuffled in a smidge before noon. Thought I was running easy for the first half but maybe still going too fast (mostly 8 minute miles with a few faster sections which should be alright since my breathing was easy the whole time, but now I'm less confident about my target marathon race pace).

I thought I'd try Yasso 800s for the first time today since I was working out solo. Didn't make it to 10 reps (I did 9 and had to quit). I can see how this workout can be used as a marathon predictor... it's all about glycogen depletion! Kept the 400m recovery laps faster than a jog, at around 2 minutes or less (8-minute pace for recovery). Splits (800m): 3:32, 3:16, 3:13, 3:07, 3:05, 3:10, 3:07, 3:15, 3:12.  Based on this workout my target marathon goal ought to be around 3 hours 15 minutes or better, and sub-3 hours is probably not realistic.	4	Altra Samson		537

Average time for 10 reps was 3:02, so if you believe Yassos are predictive of marathon time I might have a shot at going under 3 hours or at least getting a BQ (need 3 hrs 10 min).

I ran / walked with my daughter. She was very competitive and had a few good surges to keep from getting passed. Then a side stitch got her going up the steep hill to 8th Ave so we mostly walked back to the store. She ran almost a full mile before needing to stop.

I started the morning by exploring the hiking trails on the south side of Millhopper Road. Then I followed blue blaze trail to a service road, crossed the gate into the wilderness area, and ended up on horse trails on the north side of the park. Lots of mountain bikes out today. I wandered on curvy singletrack to the north parking area to refill my water bottles and cool down. I was hot and tired by this point (3 hours in and approaching noon), so I wanted to avoid the singletrack on the way back. I needed to get to the bridges near the Soggy Bottom / CreekSide loops to hop back on the horse trails and find that gate. Never did find my way. Next time I will take a map. After getting lost, using up all my food and gels, and almost running out of water, I decided to cross the wilderness swamp that I had used in years past (follow the powerlines). I didn't need to wade through anything more than ankle-deep water (whew!). I did a lot walking during that last hour. I was glad to arrive back at my car with cold water and food waiting for me. Today was a nice adventure (despite the biting flies and ticks), and I saw a couple of hawks, a big wise old owl, some deer (including a cute little fawn), and a large herd of feral pigs. Love the Vapor Gloves.	4	Merrell Vapor Glove red	hot sunny	3541

Rainy, sloppy, muddy, fun, AWESOME!  I earned 2nd overall and even got a 10k age group PR out of it with 38:16.  My NB Minimus Trail MT00 shoes did great, no trouble in the slippery sections, great traction, they drained well and didn't absorb water. Mile Splits: 6:24, 6:33, 6:22, 6:22, 6:32, 6:02 (last 1.2 miles, maybe the course was a little short?).  Thanks Dan C. for the post-race beer!	5	New Balance Minimus MT00 green	rain	470

She said ""I want to run with you!"" How could I say ""no"" to that?  We ran around our neighborhood together in the dark for a little bit before I sat her down with breakfast and then I finished packing up to hit the trails of San Felasco. I ran from the south side hiking trails to the north side horse trails. I explored some of the mountain bike trails such as ""Hidden Rise"". I only saw two groups of riders and otherwise had the north side trails to myself. I am kind of estimating pace and distance, but this was definitely my lifetime longest run ever!   Weather was nice with a breeze and light mist much of the morning. Nature today included a snake that I almost stepped on, I think it was a cottonmouth!

My fitness is about where I thought it was (coming back from the foot injury). Today's time was 4 minutes slower than last year which I'm ok with considering how undertrained I am (out of racing shape!).

A month ago I added 3 new training elements (steep hill sprints, 1000m intervals, and tempo runs). This week probably should have been a recovery week if I were following a schedule.

I don't like them for a trail shoe due to the weight, tall stack height, and lack of traction on dirt, leaves, and grass. I think cushioned shoes cause more jarring in my upper body. Had to be very careful with my form. Noticed a pain in my ab muscles. Also developed a visual artifact (possibly due to broken capillary or something). High perceived effort by the end due to 77 degrees and 73% humidity. Drank no fuel or water for run.	4	Altra Olympus		1552

These will probably only come out on cold and dark situations. They are a bit more revealing than true running tights and I had to keep pulling them up for the first half of the run (the waist kept riding down).  However, they kept me quite comfortable, not too hot or cold, on this morning in the low 40s. Generally felt good this morning.	3	Merrell Bare Access 2		970

This year the course was single loop with a significant portion through the wooded area by the creek (which was dry). Some steep hills and some long gradual uphills made for a challenging course. 4th overall and felt like I had a solid run. Forgot my watch but the course had no mile markers anyway.	5	NB Minimus MT00 green pair 2		238
