The longest part of the shoe seems too close to the middle of the shoe, rather than offset in front of the big toe.  Also, the top of the shoe stretches over the big toe like a tent (as if there is not enough internal height). Not sure if a larger size would fix these issues or maybe just have to run in them more than once.",

I guess I let my speed creep up from there.  I was pretty tired by the end, though. The biggest change I notice as a result of introducing hill intervals into my training is that I have more knee lift / power / drive in each stride.  If my legs recover I might run the 5k with the Duck on Saturday."

The views of Grandfather Mountain and the surrounding area were spectacular.  Soft Star RunAmoc DASH with trail sole were awesome for this run.  The trail sole had plenty of protection from the roots and traction was great on the rounded boulders of the Appalachians.  According to my watch I was actually 10 minutes slower on the way down than the way up.  I did not run with GPS but according to this site I believe the elevation of my run ranged from 3600 feet - 4600 feet.  http://b-fick.com/gps/2008/tanawha-trail",

The excitement got to me and I went out too fast, I was way ahead of my breathing and hurting for most of the race.  Wore my Soft Star RunAmoc Smooth moccasins.  They were awesome on the grassy and trail sections, did fine on the road sections.  One thing I didn't like about the course is that we caught up to the slow walkers with their strollers and kids, so I had to weave and dodge in the last mile to avoid plowing through some people or running over the little ones who stopped right in front of me to pick something up off the trail.  Lots of good runners there today, luckily overall awards went 3-deep so I managed to win my age group. Official time 40:27. Mile splits:  6:08, 6:27, 6:43, 6:47, 6:32, 6:36.",

Ran from the south side of San Felasco (hiking trails) along the power lines to the north side, then did Hammock Hub and part of Tung Nut loop. Really fun run! The only tricky part was crossing the wilderness area.  I think my GPS cheated me out of some distance, especially on the twisty parts, since the legs felt strong and that I was moving better than 10:30 pace.  I saw deer and some feral pigs, very few humans.  Foot bothered me just a little bit during the run but didn't notice my ribs at all.  Wore my Soft Star Dash trail mocs in prep for upcoming Trail of Payne race... they rock!"

      "description" : "Flatwoods 5k race in the Austin Carey Memorial Forest. A really nice race venue on a flat course, close to town, with excellent event organization.  1st in my age group and 2nd overall.  Splits:  6:05, 6:09, 6:17, 0:34.  Wore my NB Minimus Trail Zero which were really great for this packed limestone roadway with loose bits here and there. I feel like I'm getting into race shape.",

Had a nice strong breeze the whole time bringing in cloud cover. I think it would have been hot and miserable otherwise. The trails are nice and wide (and flat), this might make a good location for a group trail run. There is of course some sugar sand but really not bad, most trails are covered in leaves or pine needles or planted in grass. The Yellow loop is a convenient 5k. Taking a map along was very helpful, I would have had trouble without it.  Wore my NB MT00 sockless, had no issues.  Lesson of the day: Top of your water bottle when you get the chance.

However, it was still hot.  Had a decent race but fizzled a bit on mile 3, wasn't really mentally prepared for the pain and suffering.  Won my age group and 7th overall.  I was invited to run in the team challenge, our team got 2nd place which means a donation to Tyler's Hope (a foundation for research into treating Dystonia).  Felt good to contribute to the team effort.",

Didn't let myself fall off the pace during mile 3, kept yelling at myself to go go go and fought through the pain. I was mentally ready for this one today. I wanted that elusive sub-19 minute 5k and got it!  Last mile must have been haulin'. Earned 4th overall and 2nd in my age group. Inov-8 Bare-X 150 are great road racing shoes."

I wore my Altra Sampsons for the first time in a while. I think my previous Achilles complaints from these shoes stemmed from the fact that I was doing it wrong. Better form = no pains.

I felt really bad towards the end, muscles started getting crampy. I thought maybe I drank too much water (carrying two bottles that I refilled multiple times) but when I got home I weighed myself, still about 5 pounds under starting weight so I actually probably didn't drink enough. I was hoping to go closer to 26 miles but I really hit a wall after 3 hours. I haven't run near this distance in a long time so considering everything, I'm happy. And sleepy. Nap time.",

Unfortunately the \"sugar\" was all gone by the 2nd lap and I crashed hard shortly after 2 hours. It seems like once I start taking sweets I will have to keep it going in.

      "description" : "Lloyd Clarke Sports put on a good race today. The weather was perfect. I improved over last year's race by 43 seconds and since I ran smarter this year, the race was so much more enjoyable. Finished 1st in my age group with a time of 39:44. The plan was to go out under control, just try to stay nice and smooth. I think I executed well, felt strong through the 2nd half of the race, crushed mile 5, had a great finish kick.

      "description" : "Longest run of my whole life! Wasn't feeling perfect, I had some stomach distress yesterday and this morning probably due to some \"unusual\" famers' market greens I ate yesterday. Took fuel along (mostly honey). I guess it helped, but I still hit a wall at mile 20. Legs just quit, couldn't lift them. It also warmed up a lot by the time I shuffled in a smidge before noon. Thought I was running easy for the first half but maybe still going too fast (mostly 8 minute miles with a few faster sections which should be alright since my breathing was easy the whole time, but now I'm less confident about my target marathon race pace). Marathoners are CRAZY for running that far. ;)  Tested race day equipment: RaceReady shorts with pockets, Inov-8 Bare-X Lite 150, gel containers, and my Florida Track Club singlet. Also carried water but I won't do that on race day.",

      "description" : "A long day of trail running at San Felasco in the heat wearing my Merrell Vapor Gloves. I started the morning by exploring the hiking trails on the south side of Millhopper Road. Then I followed blue blaze trail to a service road, crossed the gate into the wilderness area, and ended up on horse trails on the north side of the park. Lots of mountain bikes out today. I wandered on curvy singletrack to the north parking area to refill my water bottles and cool down. I was hot and tired by this point (3 hours in and approaching noon), so I wanted to avoid the singletrack on the way back. I needed to get to the bridges near the Soggy Bottom / CreekSide loops to hop back on the horse trails and find that gate. Never did find my way. Next time I will take a map. After getting lost, using up all my food and gels, and almost running out of water, I decided to cross the wilderness swamp that I had used in years past (follow the powerlines). I didn't need to wade through anything more than ankle-deep water (whew!). I did a lot walking during that last hour. I was glad to arrive back at my car with cold water and food waiting for me. Today was a nice adventure (despite the biting flies and ticks), and I saw a couple of hawks, a big wise old owl, some deer (including a cute little fawn), and a large herd of feral pigs. Love the Vapor Gloves.",

She said \"I want to run with you!\" How could I say \"no\" to that?  We ran around our neighborhood together in the dark for a little bit before I sat her down with breakfast and then I finished packing up to hit the trails of San Felasco. I ran from the south side hiking trails to the north side horse trails. I explored some of the mountain bike trails such as \"Hidden Rise\". I only saw two groups of riders and otherwise had the north side trails to myself. I am kind of estimating pace and distance, but this was definitely my lifetime longest run ever!   Weather was nice with a breeze and light mist much of the morning. Nature today included a snake that I almost stepped on, I think it was a cottonmouth! Now, two weeks of recovery before my 50k race."

Had to be very careful with my form. Noticed a pain in my ab muscles. Also developed a visual artifact (possibly due to broken capillary or something). High perceived effort by the end due to 77 degrees and 73% humidity. Drank no fuel or water for run."
