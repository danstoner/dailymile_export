I started the morning by exploring the hiking trails on the south side of Millhopper Road. Then I followed blue blaze trail to a service road, crossed the gate into the wilderness area, and ended up on horse trails on the north side of the park. Lots of mountain bikes out today. I wandered on curvy singletrack to the north parking area to refill my water bottles and cool down. I was hot and tired by this point (3 hours in and approaching noon), so I wanted to avoid the singletrack on the way back. I needed to get to the bridges near the Soggy Bottom / CreekSide loops to hop back on the horse trails and find that gate. Never did find my way. Next time I will take a map. After getting lost, using up all my food and gels, and almost running out of water, I decided to cross the wilderness swamp that I had used in years past (follow the powerlines). I didn't need to wade through anything more than ankle-deep water (whew!). I did a lot walking during that last hour. I was glad to arrive back at my car with cold water and food waiting for me. Today was a nice adventure (despite the biting flies and ticks), and I saw a couple of hawks, a big wise old owl, some deer (including a cute little fawn), and a large herd of feral pigs.
